Data science project focuses on using a feedforward neural network (multilayer perceptron - MLP) to predict whether it will rain the next day based on Australian weather data, specifically the humidity at 3 pm.

The project pipeline includes steps from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring, with a key emphasis on simplicity and achieving remarkable results with a basic architecture.
